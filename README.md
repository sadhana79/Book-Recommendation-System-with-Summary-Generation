This project helps students find academic books based on keyword searches and provides AI-generated summaries to save time and improve learning.

 Features
- 🔍 **TF-IDF based Book Recommendations**  
- 📝 **TextRank Algorithm for Automatic Summary Generation**  
- 📚 Clean UI for searching and reading books  
- 👩‍🎓 Targeted for engineering students and academic learners

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Django
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF)
- NLTK / Gensim (TextRank)
- HTML / CSS

💡 How It Works
1. User searches by keyword (e.g., “Data Structures”)
2. System returns the top relevant books using **TF-IDF**
3. When user selects a book, it generates a **summary** using **TextRank**
